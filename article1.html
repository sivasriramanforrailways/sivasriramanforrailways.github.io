    <p>
        My experience in Indian Railways gave me exposure to
        real-world safety-critical systems that go far beyond
        classroom learning.
    </p>

    <p>
        From understanding operational discipline to observing
        how signaling decisions impact thousands of passengers,
        the experience reshaped my perspective on engineering.
    </p>

    <p>
        Indian Railways taught me that reliability is not optional —
        it is a responsibility.
